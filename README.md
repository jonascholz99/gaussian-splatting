# Research Project Base - gsplat.js Framework

## Overview

This repository contains a modified version of the `gsplat.js` framework by Hugging Face, specifically adapted for the needs of a particular research project. The original basis for this code can be found here: [gsplat.js on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/gsplat.js).

## Modifications

The framework has been customized by me to meet specific requirements and functionalities for the research project. Changes include modifications in data processing, integration of special modules, and a tailored configuration specifically aimed at the project's objectives.

## Intended Use

The code in this repository is not intended for public use. It has been developed specifically for use within this research project and should not be used for other purposes without proper authorization. Any use outside of this project context requires explicit consent from the project management.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the team at Hugging Face for providing the `gsplat.js` framework, which serves as the foundation for this project-specific adaptation.
